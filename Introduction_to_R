1) Data types
Atomic data types
numeric
integer
character
complex (ex: 1+i)
Date
PosXit and PosXct

2) Coding standards
Make it readable
Indent
Use only 80 characters
Dont have more than 4 For loops

3) Functions and Scoping

Scopings are Lexical and Dynamics. Its primarily to determine, the values of variables defined locally in a function,
inside a function's function, Globally etc.

4) PosXIT and POSXCT is the way Time variabale is defined. Its value is length of time from 12:00:00
DATE is the way date variable is stored. Its value is the length of time from 1970-01-01

5) Control Loops

If else
for
while
repeat
break
next (skip an iteration)

6) Str function
provides the structure of an Object. ** Very Important **

7) Debugging Options
traceback -> provides previously executed command
debug -> starts from the top of function
browser -> starts anywhere in a function. 
trace
recover

8) Profiing
Mainly to know where the program is taking longer time.

#Code Snippet
Rprof("Rprof.out", line.profiling=TRUE)
code_functions
Rprof(NULL) #disables
summaryRprof

# outputs are printed
# $by.self will display time taken by each step
# $by.total will display which upper level has taken more time. Not much useful
